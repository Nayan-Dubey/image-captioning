Image Captioning System
An AI-based system that generates textual descriptions for images by combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques. This project uses a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and an LSTM-based neural network for sequence generation.

Features
Image Feature Extraction: Utilizes the VGG16 pre-trained model to extract feature vectors from images.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes image captions, creating a vocabulary for training.
Caption Generation: Combines image features and text sequences to generate meaningful captions using an LSTM-based model.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using BLEU scores to measure the accuracy of generated captions.
Real-Time Captioning: Supports generating captions for new images with pre-trained models.
Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras
VGG16 for feature extraction
LSTM for sequence modeling
BLEU Score for evaluation
Dataset
The project uses the Flickr8k Dataset, which contains 8,000 images and their corresponding captions.
How It Works
Feature Extraction: Extracts image features using the VGG16 model.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes captions, adding startseq and endseq tokens for training.
Model Training: Trains a combined CNN-LSTM model to generate captions.
Caption Generation: Generates captions for new images by predicting one word at a time.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model using BLEU-1 to BLEU-4 scores.
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-system.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model:
Place the Flickr8k Dataset in the appropriate directory.
Run the training script to train the model.
Generate captions for new images:
Use the pre-trained model to generate captions for any image.
Results
Achieved high BLEU scores for caption accuracy.
Successfully generated meaningful captions for unseen images.
Future Improvements
Extend the model to support larger datasets like MS COCO.
Improve caption quality using transformer-based models like BERT or GPT.
